<h1>🤝 Negotiation: Get What You Deserve</h1>

<blockquote>"You don't get what you deserve. You get what you negotiate."</blockquote>

<h2>Before Negotiating</h2>
<div class="tip"><strong>Know your BATNA.</strong> Best Alternative To Negotiated Agreement. Your walk-away point.</div>
<div class="tip"><strong>Research market rates.</strong> Know what's fair before you ask.</div>
<div class="tip"><strong>Understand their constraints.</strong> What do they need? What limits them?</div>
<div class="tip"><strong>Prepare your case.</strong> Facts and examples, not feelings.</div>
<div class="tip"><strong>Practice out loud.</strong> Rehearse responses to objections.</div>

<h2>During Negotiation</h2>
<div class="tip"><strong>Let them go first.</strong> You might be surprised (higher or lower).</div>
<div class="tip"><strong>Anchor high (or low).</strong> First number shapes the conversation.</div>
<div class="tip"><strong>Use silence.</strong> After they speak, pause. They often improve their offer.</div>
<div class="tip"><strong>Never accept first offer.</strong> There's always room.</div>
<div class="tip"><strong>Ask "How did you arrive at that number?"</strong> Makes them justify.</div>
<div class="tip"><strong>Use "I" not "You".</strong> "I was hoping for X" not "You should give me X"</div>
<div class="tip"><strong>Get beyond positions to interests.</strong> What do they really want?</div>

<h2>Salary Negotiation</h2>
<div class="tip"><strong>Never give a number first.</strong> "I'm flexible - what's the range for this role?"</div>
<div class="tip"><strong>Use ranges, aim high.</strong> "I'm looking for $85-95K" (want $85K)</div>
<div class="tip"><strong>Negotiate more than salary.</strong> Bonus, vacation, remote work, title, start date.</div>
<div class="tip"><strong>Get it in writing.</strong> Before you accept.</div>
<div class="tip"><strong>Timing matters.</strong> After offer, before acceptance is your leverage peak.</div>

<h2>Phrases That Work</h2>
<div class="tip">
"Based on my research..."<br>
"I'm excited about this, and..."<br>
"Is there flexibility on..."<br>
"What would it take to get to X?"<br>
"Can you help me understand..."<br>
"I'd like to find a solution that works for both of us."
